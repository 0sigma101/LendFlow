Problem that exists but no one cares about
=================

The problem tackled here is the non-transparency of the money lending that brought various problems to India, like the Nirav Modi Scam or the Vijay Mallya Scam, which are still unsolvable.
The problem of Lending money but with transparency

DeFi
--------
We also solve the problem of corruption where all the lending will be transparent and will solve the major problem of Decentralized Finance

Corruption
----------
The money that has been used up by people exploiting the nation can be brought out in front of the public. Not only this the feature of collateral gives user the option to extract the collateral without lenders' permission making the system secure is one of the major features that were to get into force.

Challenges are the ones that teach us big lessons
=================

<li>The lack of motivation making us think the project is undoable</li>
<li>The Linking of Blockchain with javascript is super tedious</li>
<li>Due to time constrain and the ongoing classes We were unable to add the frontend.</li>
<li>Majority of team members putting their hands onto the idea for the first time.</li>
<li>Due to sudden change in plans our majority of time was taken in idea phase.</li>

Playing as the smart
--------
The problem statement seemed vague and we werefeeling discouraged about the idea. We planned to keep our heads high and work our way out and we tried to tackle the maximum challenges from our end.

Learnings
----------
think of a project idea that the whole team can work on. Don't put your head towards the learning phase building phase is more important.
